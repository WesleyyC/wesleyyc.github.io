* [Jeeves](https://github.com/arikalfus/Jeeves) is a voice-powered virtual assistant for everyday routines and **the Runner-Up of AVIOS Mobile Speech Application Contest 2015**. 


* Jeeves focuses on natural, conversational dialogue so the user doesn't have to remember a list of restricted commands. After a 5-week intensive course to learn the relevant technologies, Jeeves was imagined and realized in just another 5 weeks.


* Features include: Reading email, current news, and weather, natural language understanding, dialogue management
